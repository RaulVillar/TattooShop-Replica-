# TattooShop-Replica-

Replica of a Tattoo's shop template.

OBJECTIVE: As an apprentice in web developing I have been told to build up a replica of a template of my wish. Making use of my skills on FIGMA, JIRA, HTML and CSS, the objective is to create a visually pleasing and functional replica of a Tatto Shop. 

STEPS: I will write down in order every step I have followed during this process.  
  1. Using JIRA to divide tasks (AGILE METHODOLGY).
  2. Making a visual replica on FIGMA.
  3. Coding on HTML and CSS the initial webpage *I have been doing minor improvents in the code every time I had the chance to learn something new*.
  4. Uploading every new version to GitHub so I have it well secured. 

PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED:
  1. Understand how flex-boxes work (Margins and paddings)
  2. Responsive for every type of device. 
  4. Fix the section 3 (Services): picture must go all the way to the left. 

The webpage is still under development.
