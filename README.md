Replica of a Tattoo's shop template.

OBJECTIVE: As an apprentice in web developing I have been told to build up a replica of a template of my wish. Making use of my skills on FIGMA, JIRA, HTML and CSS, the objective is to create a visually pleasing and functional replica of a Tatto Shop. 

STEPS: I will write down in order every step I have followed during this process.  
  1. Using JIRA to divide tasks (AGILE METHODOLGY).
  2. Making a visual replica on FIGMA.
  3. Coding on HTML and CSS the initial webpage *I have been doing minor improvements on the code every time I had the chance to learn something new*.

PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED:
  1. Responsive for every type of device. 

The webpage is still under development.
